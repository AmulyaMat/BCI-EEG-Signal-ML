# Analysing Evoked Potentials and classifying EEG signals through Machine Learning & Deep Learning

This was a learning project provided to me by a start up company. I was given 4 tasks to complete and deliver results in a week. Each task is written in a google colab notebook with concise code and detailed 
annotations.
